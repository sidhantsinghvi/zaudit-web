# Zaudit Competitive Positioning Assets

Use these assets for the “Why Zaudit”, “Comparison”, or marketing landing pages. They live under `docs/assets/` so your design and web teams can import them directly.

## 1. Cost vs Feature Depth (SVG)

- **File**: `docs/assets/zaudit-cost-feature.svg`
- **What it shows**: Places Zaudit in the high-feature, lower-cost quadrant versus Tally, Marg, Zoho, Busy, etc.
- **Usage**: Embed directly in HTML/React, or copy into Figma via “Paste as SVG”.

Snippet (HTML):

```html
<figure>
  <img src="./assets/zaudit-cost-feature.svg" alt="Cost vs feature depth comparison of Zaudit versus Tally, Zoho, and others" />
  <figcaption>Zaudit delivers ERP-level depth without the enterprise price tag.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## 2. Automation vs Productivity Gains (SVG)

- **File**: `docs/assets/zaudit-automation-productivity.svg`
- **What it shows**: Highlights Zaudit’s automation advantage and time-saving impact versus Suvit, ClearTax, Zoho Books, Tally, etc.
- **Usage**: Same as above. Works well in presentations, landing pages, or comparison sections.

Snippet (HTML):

```html
<figure>
  <img src="./assets/zaudit-automation-productivity.svg" alt="Automation vs productivity scatter plot highlighting Zaudit" />

</figure>
```

### Design Notes

- Colors and typography use neutral defaults. Update to match your brand tokens if needed.
- All text labels are editable inside vector tools (Figma/Illustrator).
- Because the charts are pure SVG, they scale perfectly for Retina displays and print.

If you need alternate color palettes, translated copy, or raster exports, let the team know and we can add more variants.
